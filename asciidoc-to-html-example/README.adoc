= Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven plugin: Asciidoc to HTML example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to HTML5 using the Asciidoctor Maven plugin
and the Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven plugin.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML5:

[source,shell]
$ mvn

or

[source,shell]
$ mvn asciidoctor-convert

Open the file _target/generated-docs/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file.

== Differences from the original example

. `process-asciidoc` is executed on `asciidoctor-convert` phase, not in `process-resources` phase.
. The kindlegen execution was commented because it is not relevant for this example.
. The example project packaging is `pom`, instead of `jar`, to avoid generating an empty jar.
. Please, note that if you invoke the `package` goal you don't get nothing.
This is the expected result, because we are using the Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven Plugin.
