= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: Asciidoc theme example

This is an example of how a theme can be build to reuse them in our projects.
Remember that there is no formal definition neither proposal about a theme, so the
structure must be anything you want with the requirements of Asciidoctor.

In this example, a theme is only a zip file that contains a `pdf` directory for store resources
for pdf theming.

This example create a theme by zipping the contents of `src/asciidoc/themes` to a file.

== Usage

Create and install the theme using:

[source,shell]
mvn install

== Notes

This example has no equivalent in original Asciidoctor Maven Examples.

This example shows a way to reuse themes in many projects.
