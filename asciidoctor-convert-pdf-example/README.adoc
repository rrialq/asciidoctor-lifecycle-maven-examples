= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: AsciiDoc to PDF Example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin
and the Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven plugin.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF by invoking the `build` goal:

 $ mvn build

Open the file _target/generated-docs/example-manual.pdf_ in your PDF viewer to see the generated PDF.

== Differences from the original example

. `process-asciidoc` is executed on `build` phase, not in `process-resources` phase.
. The example project packaging is `pom`, instead of `jar`, to avoid generating an empty jar.
. Please, note that if you invoke the `package` goal you don't get nothing.
This is the expected result, because we are using the lifecycle.
